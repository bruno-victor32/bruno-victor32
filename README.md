## Hello world! ✌️
I'm Bruno Victor, 
I'm passionate about technology,
I am a student taking advantage of all the opportunities that arise to acquire new knowledge and then put it into practice as a junior or intern developer.

- 🔓  I’m currently unlocking some knowledge on JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node, that means I´m a student in process of turning into a junior dev.
- 🚀  I'm in a career transition :) Studying at Rocketseat while working with Civil Construction. 
- ⚡ Studing Technologies: Javascript, HTML, CSS, Node, Typescript.
- 💀 Dying for an opportunity in the dev world.
